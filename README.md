# Analysis of Variance

**Introduction**

This analysis will look at a linear model to partition the total variation (variance) for a variable of interest using one categorical variable (one-way ANOVA), or two categorical variables (two-way ANOVA) as the model (explained variation). An SRS of 80 will be drawn independently from three populations based on diet quality (good diet, fair diet, and poor diet) from a total of 350 subjects each and analyzed using Minitab statistical software.

**Objectives**

The objective of this analysis is to understand the concept of linear models, the assumptions underlying ANOVA analysis and how to state an ANOVA hypothesis. An experiment in which two or more factors are investigated simultaneously is called a factorial experiment. For the three populations, ANOVA and Tukey testing will be performed. The two measures of quality we will look at is explanatory power of the model given as the ratio of the explained variation to the total variation, and the statistical significance of the model p-value and F test statistic, using hypothesis testing concepts. The objective is to identify whether the researcher can conclude that the three populations differ with respect to mean RBC folate value.
